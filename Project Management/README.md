## Project Background

Transport for NSW wishes to undertake research and trials to move NSW towards a future with Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) and has provided $2m for this.
You need to design a project that will:
- Retrofit 12 road vehicle with CAV capabilities
- Integrate sensors and AI systems
- Trial the vehicles on NSW roads and obtain data from trials to assess the compatibility of NSW road infrastructure.
- Make recommendations on how CAV data can contribute to the next generation of AI-based technologies of interest to TfNSW, which are: network management, incident response, and positioning.
